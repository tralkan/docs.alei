## Ideas for Future Development

- Secure DeFi apps such as stablecoins.

- Add social recovery to programs such as those in the [Leo Examples](https://developer.aleo.org/leo/examples).

- Remove social-recovery guardians one by one.

- Automatically recover the account once the number of approvals reaches the threshold (without requiring the Recover Account transaction).
