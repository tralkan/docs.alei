# Deploy App

Tyron can help secure any app on Aleo, such as an NFT collection. So, as an example, let's use `demox-labs/art-factory` to develop a Leo NFT App protected by Tyron Social Recovery.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Connect Wallet" %}
Begin by connecting your Leo Wallet, which is an externally owned account (also known as a key-based wallet), to the front-end application.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Then sign in with your app's program ID or deploy a new one by clicking "Deploy New App". Remember to save the unique name of your program, such as "tyron_leo_nft.aleo".
