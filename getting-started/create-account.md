# :closed_lock_with_key: Create Account

Creating an account involves initializing the ownership of the program by setting the owner or "controller" of the application. As an example, we used `demox-labs/art-factory` to develop a Leo NFT App with Tyron Social Recovery, which is a collection of unique tokens on the Aleo blockchain.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="1. Connect Wallet" %}
Begin by connecting your Leo Wallet, which is an externally owned account (also known as a key-based wallet), to the front-end application.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="2. Send Transaction" %}
First, enter the program ID that corresponds to your app, for example, "tyron_leo_nft_test.aleo".

Next, to designate your Leo Wallet as the app controller, just click on "Create Account". This action will create an **AppController** private record that you, as the account owner, will need to provide as proof of ownership.
{% endtab %}
