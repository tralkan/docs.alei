# Create Account

Creating an account involves initializing the ownership of the program by setting the owner or "controller" of the application.

{% tabs %}

<!-- {% tab title="1. Connect Wallet" %}
Begin by connecting your Leo Wallet, which is an externally owned account (also known as a key-based wallet), to the front-end application.
{% endtab %} -->

{% tab title="Send Transaction" %}
To designate your Leo Wallet as the app controller, click "Create Account". This action will create an **AppController** private record that you, as the account owner, will have available as proof of ownership.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
